## Data Review
1. Selected Data Sources
   - Neighborhood Areas, Neighborhood Names, Boroughs, Demographics
   - Just a few ideas: 
   If I have information about Neighborhood Areas and Names and if I had geospatial information about people's income, I could find out income details by neighborhood.

	If I have information about tree census in NYC and if I had Neighborhood Census, I could compare amount of trees to amount of people.

	If I have demographic data set of NYC and if I had info on all boroughs, I could analyze what types of people live in each borough.

2. Supplemental Sources

  - NYC Open Data: Income, Housing Violations, Housing Affordability, Crime Rates

3. Questions

  - What types of uses for this data have you, at the lab, employed for analysis? (What is the most interesting type of analysis youâ€™ve come across with these data sets?)
  - How granular could I cross-reference the data?  For example, if I wanted income broken down specifially by demographics within specific neighborhoods/boroughs and each demographics' associated crime rate per neighborhood/borough?
  - Is there any chance of misleading information when it comes to cross-referencing data?  In other words, how do you know when you have enough data to really make a statement about something?
