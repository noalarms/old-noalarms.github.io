I did it. I got in. Not just any program, but a GREAT program. :-)
Like seriously my life is bleak, I'm unemployed, depressed and suffer from severe anxiety
What?!?!? I had no idea this sort of thing existed!

I can't believe it's not butter.
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job and heaven knows I'm miserable now.
My cat died. I no longer wish to live.
Wait, I won the lottery! I'm ecstatic!
I HATE this so much! But, to be honest, I really LOVE it!
I have no feelings one way or another.

I like how efficient and nice the NYC MTA subway system is.
Stop predatory policing in the #MTA transit system by #NYPD #SwipeItForward
#TransitAlert #MTA Downtown 6 trains run express from 42 St to 14 St or Bklyn Bridge/ City Hall due to NYPD activity.
Of course the 7 train is delayed #mta #nyc
I just want to be held momentarily by the train's dispatcher #mta
Been stuck on this #MTA #Ftrain so long I'm about to change my mailing address
Good luck getting to work this morning. Pretty much every train is fucked. #MTA #FuckMTA
Trains were truly a pile of hot garbage this morning. ðŸ‘Œ #MTA #Ftrain
How do we revolutionize the #mta? Train mechanic problem causing hour long delays? Then stop raising fare & get it together. #fareabatement
I don't think the #MTA understands the seasons. When it's cold out you turn on the heat not the air and when it's hot out you turn on the AC
It's always fun standing on a packed A train for an hour with elbows in your side. Thank you @TotalSoccerShow for making it okay. #mta #tss
"F*ck your plans" -the NYC subway
A rat almost ran over my feet. #nycSubway #MTA @MTA @NYCTSubway
Just watched someone yell at the train conductor because she got on the wrong train!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ #mta #nycsubway
The stairs at the Broadway stop that were being fixed for months have finally opened. Woo hoo! #broadway #mta #astoria ðŸšƒ
I try to sing in funny like Beck, but it's bringing me down. Lower than ground. Beautiful ground.
